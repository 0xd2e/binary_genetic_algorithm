# Binary genetic algorithm

Simple binary genetic algorithm engine.

Main features:
 * fixed size linear chromosomes
 * randomly generated initial population
 * fitness proportionate (roulette wheel) selection
 * single point mutation based on independent and uniformly distributed random variable
 * single crossover (recombination) point
 * minimum fitness threshold and maximum number of iterations termination conditions
